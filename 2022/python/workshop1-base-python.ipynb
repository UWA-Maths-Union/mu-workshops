Being able to boil a problem down into the smaller problems and individual steps is hands-down **THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF CODING**. Once you break down the problem into the individual steps, the remaining part is just translating those steps into the Python language (which can then be understood by the Python interpretter).\n",

You may have heard \"your first programming language is the hardest to learn\", and that is partly due to getting a grip on this problem solving aspect.\n"

They can be thought of as \"mods\" which extend the capabilities of base Python.\n",

Popular packages also come with lots of documentation on how to use them, including instructions and API references. Working with these packages often results in much cleaner code (as these frameworks have been refined) and code that is easier for others to understand as they probably use the same package.\n",
