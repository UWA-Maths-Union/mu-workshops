Popular packages also come with lots of documentation on how to use them, including instructions and API references. Working with these packages often results in much cleaner code (as these frameworks have been refined) and code that is easier for others to understand as they probably use the same package.\n",

This separates Python from other languages like C and R which use `{}` to indicate blocks of code. Indentation in Python is very important for denoting blocks of code.\n",

The `get_pi` function is an example of a function that has no parameters. Hence when we call it in the `circle_area` function, we just call `get_pi()` with nothing in the brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, from `get_pi()` within `circle_area` we can see that we can call functions from other functions (seemingly before that function was even defined??!!). To understand this, lets talk about how Python runs this code. When Python sees the function definitions (ie. `def my_function...`) and their associated code it actually doesn't run any code. Python just associates the `get_pi` and `circle_area` keywords with those blocks of code. When you call those functions in future only then will it run the code. When we get to line 12 and 13, the function `circle_area` is actually called with `radius` as the parameter. This value for radius of `5` gets passed into the function and renamed to r in the context of the `circle_area` function. The `circle_area` function runs, and since the `get_pi` function was already **defined before the time of execution**, the function executes without a hitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we see that `circle_area` has multiple return statements. This is completely valid, and very useful. This means that we can terminate the execution of our function early if a condition isn't met. This can allow us to avoid deeply nested if/else statements.\n",
    "\n",

When the `print(c)` is reached outside the function, the variable `c` is no longer defined (the local scope is gone, and `c` is not defined in the enclosing, global or built-in scopes).  \n",

    "These are some of the options that you can use for imported functions. The nice thing about imports, which sets Python apart from Matlab or R, is that imported packages are by default separated into their own namespace. When we run `import math`, we can them use all the `math` functions by calling `math.function_name`. This makes it easy to trace back where a function comes from (and then look up the functions documentation and how to use it). This also means that if we have two functions with the same names from different packages, it doesn't matter because when we import them they will be in different namespaces (ie. `package1.func_name` and `package2.func_name`). Compare this to R or Matlab, where importing packages/libraries just kind of shoves all the functions into a communal bucket, and if there are name collisions between packages it just uses one of the function definitions, which of course might not be the function you're looking for and may behave completely differently, and *ugh*... such a headache.\n",
