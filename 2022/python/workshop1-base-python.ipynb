    "- Workshop 1\n",
    "    - Goes over many of the foundations of Python including base Python, while still being a ~2 hour workshop\n",
    "    - Already done an intro to Python course? There will be a lot of overlap with this workshop (particularly the \"Base Python\" component)\n",
    "- Workshop 2\n",
    "    - Goes over two of the fundamental scientific computing packages (numpy and matplotlib), and how to use them in mathematical contexts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Can't get enough Python?**:  \n",
    "There are many amazing free courses online that cover the topics in these workshops. These courses also cover `pandas` (not covered in these workshops), an amazing tool for dealing with heterogenous CSV/tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn): Has course modules covering topics relevant to data science (free platform)\n",
    "- [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/): Has many course modules covering topics relevant to data science (paid platform; 3 month free trial with [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which also comes with many other perks (free Canva Pro, GitHub pro, etc.))\n",
    "- Coursera and EdX: Free access to thousands of online, university courses on a variety of different topics ([UWA has a license for Coursera](https://www.uwa.edu.au/education/educational-enhancement-unit/Strategic-Projects/Coursera) allowing you to get the completion certificates for free).\n",

    "- **IDE**: Short for \"interactive development environment\". This is the app that you use to write your code (\"Notepad\" is an IDE! Just a bad one with no syntax highlighting, or button to run code).\n",
    "- **Python interpretter**: This is the Python engine that executes your Python file. When we \"install Python\" (from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), we are installing the Python interpretter. Anaconda comes with its own Python interpretter packaged in.\n",
    "- **Packages**: Code written by others geared towards solving specific tasks. They can be thought of as \"mods\" which extend the capabilities of base Python.\n",
    "- **alias**: Usually when importing packages we give them short aliases (like `np`) in order to make them quicker to write.\n",
    "- **PyPI**: Python Package Index, this is the online repository where packages are stored.\n",
    "- **pip**: The de-facto command line tool used to install Python packages, which are often downloaded by pip from PyPI. Stands for \"pip installs packages\" (cool hey! A recursive acryonym).\n",
    "- **Anaconda**: An installation of Python that comes with all the common scientific computing packages already installed. Anaconda also comes with conda, a command line tool comparable to pip for installing packages.\n",
    "- **API**: Application programming interface. In the context of packages, the API is the interface for the package (the instructions you can use to interact with the package). Packages often come with an API reference (documentation about functions and commands related to that package).\n",
    "- **Refactor**: The act of rewriting or reorganising code in order to make it neater, easier to understand, or more efficient, without affecting the result from the code execution.\n",

    "---\n",
    "- **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/about)**: An open source, non-profit project supporting interactive data science and scientific computing. Two major contributions from this project are the Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab applications. Since Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab are similar in functionality, we can use Jupyter to refer to either of them.\n",
    "- **iPython Notebook**: A file format that contains a mixture of markdown text (paragraphs, tables, images) as well as executable code. The file extension for this file is `.ipynb`.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook**: An application developped by Jupyter used to edit, view and run iPython notebooks. \"A jupyter notebook\" can also refer to an iPython notebook.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Lab**: An application developped by Jupyter as a successor to Jupyter Notebook. It is also used to edit, view and run iPython notebooks, however has more features (particularly around viewing several notebooks, viewing your folder structure, and editting other files). This makes Jupyter Lab a more capable IDE.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- **variable**: A piece of data that has been assigned to a name within a program for use later in the program\n",
    "- **function**: A re-usable block of code with input arguments, and an output defined using a return statement\n",
    "- **argument**: An input to a function\n",
    "- **loop**: A block of code that repeats an arbitrary number of times\n",
    "- **if statement**: A block of code that executes only if a certain condition is met\n"

They can be thought of as \"mods\" which extend the capabilities of base Python.\n",

    "Popular packages are often worked on by huge communities ([numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) has over 1000 contributors), so the code is optimised and the frameworks are versatile and elegant. Popular packages also come with lots of documentation on how to use them, including instructions and API references. Working with these packages often results in much cleaner code (as these frameworks have been refined) and code that is easier for others to understand as they probably use the same package.\n",

To see and edit file extensions you'll need to update your settings accordingly ([Windows](https://vtcri.kayako.com/article/296-view-file-extensions-windows-10) and [MacOS](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/mac-help/mchlp2304/mac)).\n",

Of course VScode and Jupyter would have more features for coding than a normal text editor. \n",

The `get_pi` function is an example of a function that has no parameters. Hence when we call it in the `circle_area` function, we just call `get_pi()` with nothing in the brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, from `get_pi()` within `circle_area` we can see that we can call functions from other functions (seemingly before that function was even defined??!!). To understand this, lets talk about how Python runs this code. When Python sees the function definitions (ie. `def my_function...`) and their associated code it actually doesn't run any code. Python just associates the `get_pi` and `circle_area` keywords with those blocks of code. When you call those functions in future only then will it run the code. When we get to line 12 and 13, the function `circle_area` is actually called with `radius` as the parameter. This value for radius of `5` gets passed into the function and renamed to r in the context of the `circle_area` function. The `circle_area` function runs, and since the `get_pi` function was already **defined before the time of execution**, the function executes without a hitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we see that `circle_area` has multiple return statements. This is completely valid, and very useful. This means that we can terminate the execution of our function early if a condition isn't met. This can allow us to avoid deeply nested if/else statements.\n",
    "\n",

    "These are some of the options that you can use for imported functions. The nice thing about imports, which sets Python apart from Matlab or R, is that imported packages are by default separated into their own namespace. When we run `import math`, we can them use all the `math` functions by calling `math.function_name`. This makes it easy to trace back where a function comes from (and then look up the functions documentation and how to use it). This also means that if we have two functions with the same names from different packages, it doesn't matter because when we import them they will be in different namespaces (ie. `package1.func_name` and `package2.func_name`). Compare this to R or Matlab, where importing packages/libraries just kind of shoves all the functions into a communal bucket, and if there are name collisions between packages it just uses one of the function definitions, which of course might not be the function you're looking for and may behave completely differently, and *ugh*... such a headache.\n",
