    "- Workshop 1\n",
    "    - Goes over many of the foundations of Python including base Python, while still being a ~2 hour workshop\n",
    "    - Already done an intro to Python course? There will be a lot of overlap with this workshop (particularly the \"Base Python\" component)\n",
    "- Workshop 2\n",
    "    - Goes over two of the fundamental scientific computing packages (numpy and matplotlib), and how to use them in mathematical contexts.\n",

Being able to boil a problem down into the smaller problems and individual steps is hands-down **THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF CODING**. Once you break down the problem into the individual steps, the remaining part is just translating those steps into the Python language (which can then be understood by the Python interpretter).\n",

Popular packages also come with lots of documentation on how to use them, including instructions and API references.

    "You have lots of options for variable names, but there are [some rules](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_variable_names.asp):\n",
    "- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
    "- A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
    "- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
    "- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there is a [list of keywords that are reserved for Python use](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp) (eg. True, False, None) which stright up can't be used as variable names.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a [list of built-in Python functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) (like `sum` and `print`). Although Python won't stop you from assigning values to a built-in Python function, it will overwrite its functionality preventing you from using that function later in your code (which would be no beuno). And since this is Jupyter, you'll have to reset your kernel to get the original function back."

The `get_pi` function is an example of a function that has no parameters. Hence when we call it in the `circle_area` function, we just call `get_pi()` with nothing in the brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, from `get_pi()` within `circle_area` we can see that we can call functions from other functions (seemingly before that function was even defined??!!). To understand this, lets talk about how Python runs this code. When Python sees the function definitions (ie. `def my_function...`) and their associated code it actually doesn't run any code. Python just associates the `get_pi` and `circle_area` keywords with those blocks of code. When you call those functions in future only then will it run the code. When we get to line 12 and 13, the function `circle_area` is actually called with `radius` as the parameter. This value for radius of `5` gets passed into the function and renamed to r in the context of the `circle_area` function. The `circle_area` function runs, and since the `get_pi` function was already **defined before the time of execution**, the function executes without a hitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, we see that `circle_area` has multiple return statements. This is completely valid, and very useful. This means that we can terminate the execution of our function early if a condition isn't met. This can allow us to avoid deeply nested if/else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** A function can also have no return statement, or just have `return` with no value after. In both these cases, the value of `None` will be returned (to indicate that nothing was returned).\n",

As local scope takes precidence, this prints `2`. Once the function is complete, the local scope is destroyed.

    "These are some of the options that you can use for imported functions. The nice thing about imports, which sets Python apart from Matlab or R, is that imported packages are by default separated into their own namespace. When we run `import math`, we can them use all the `math` functions by calling `math.function_name`. This makes it easy to trace back where a function comes from (and then look up the functions documentation and how to use it). This also means that if we have two functions with the same names from different packages, it doesn't matter because when we import them they will be in different namespaces (ie. `package1.func_name` and `package2.func_name`). Compare this to R or Matlab, where importing packages/libraries just kind of shoves all the functions into a communal bucket, and if there are name collisions between packages it just uses one of the function definitions, which of course might not be the function you're looking for and may behave completely differently, and *ugh*... such a headache.\n",

    "Anyway, there is another option for Python imports as well, and that is a *wildcard import* where you can do `from math import *` which will import all the functions from math into your current namespace. Given my rant that I just did, you can probably guess [**this is a bad idea and bad practice**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3615125/should-wildcard-import-be-avoided) as it obfuscates what is imported code, versus code defined within the program, and can also cause name clashes in your program.

We mentioned that the options for range are `range(start, stop, step)` where `start` indicates the start point of our count, `stop` the end point, and `step` being the interval between each point in the sequence. We also mentioned that the interval is **closed on start** (meaning it includes start) and **open on stop** meaning the sequence excludes stop (eg. the last element in `range(0, 5, 1)` is `4`).\n",

    "Well, slicing works in a very very similar way to the range object. We specify our slice by using `:` while indexing, where we can slice a list from from `start` (inclusive) to `stop` (exclusive) by using `lst[start:stop]`. This concept takes some practice to get used to.\n",

    "- **more string methods:** Not super relevant for maths\n",
    "- **opening files in base Python:** Not super relevant for maths\n",
    "- **list comprehensions**: Amazing to know, but don't have a lot of time\n",
    "- **object oriented programming and classes:** Advanced\n",

For this reason, my advice for programmers wanting to get better is to set yourself your own projects that you think are cool.
