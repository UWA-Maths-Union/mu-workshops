    "By using `\"\"\"` we can define strings that go over multiple lines. These are commonly used by themselves to act as multiline comments (as opposed to `#` for single line comments). If they're placed straight after a function definition, they're called a docstring! As a matter of fact, every time we call `help(...)` on a function, we are actually getting the docstring in the output!"
